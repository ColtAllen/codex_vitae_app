# Codex Vitae web app
<!-- Actual text -->
This repo contains the current working source code for a Django web app that consolidates digital journal entries from a reMarkable2 account for quick retrieval and NLP analysis. It also pulls fitness, nutrition, and time management data from Garmin, MyNetDiary, and RescueTime for additional correlation and causal analyses.
